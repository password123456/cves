This bypasses the initial check that uploaded files are image files. The application relies on frontend checks to restrict the administrator from changing the extension of uploaded files to .php. This restriction is easily bypassed with any proxy tool (e.g., BurpSuite). Once the attacker renames the file, and gives it the .php extension, a GET request can be used to trigger the execution of code on the server."
