This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_handle_delete_icons() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please not the CSRF was patched in 5.0.28, however, adequate directory traversal protection wasn't introduced until 5.0.30."
